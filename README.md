# Sentiment in homeric text

We present the sentiment annotation of Homeric text, vis. the first Book of Iliad. Our dataset is publicly released. To annotate the sentiment of text in ancient Greek, we employ a modern Greek translation, which is expected to be closer to the original compared to other languages. Hence, we expect our dataset to serve as an accurate ground truth, that can be used to benchmark sentiment classifiers in any of the languages that the same text exists today (e.g., English or French).


The annotations comprise the fraction of annotators per class (positive, negative, neutral, narrator) per verse of the Book. We note that the current version of the dataset comprises only the annotations, not the verses. The verses, however, can be downloaded online. For example, [this](http://users.sch.gr/ipap/Ellinikos%20Politismos/Yliko/OMHROS-ILIADA/ARXAIO/ILIADA.htm) website.
